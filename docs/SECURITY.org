* Security Policy

** Supported Versions

Currently supported versions with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
|---------+-------------------|
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |

** Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of para-spacy-lisp seriously. If you believe you've found a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. *Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly*
2. *Email the maintainers directly* at security@example.com with details about the vulnerability
3. Include the following information:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Any suggested fixes if available

** Security Considerations

*** WebSocket Server

The WebSocket server included in this project is designed for local use only and is not secured for public-facing deployment. Consider the following:

- The server binds to localhost by default (127.0.0.1)
- No authentication is implemented
- Communication is not encrypted (uses ws:// not wss://)

If you need to deploy this in a production environment, consider:

#+begin_src python
# Example of adding TLS/SSL
import ssl
import pathlib

ssl_context = ssl.SSLContext(ssl.PROTOCOL_TLS_SERVER)
ssl_context.load_cert_chain(
    pathlib.Path("path/to/localhost.pem"),
    keyfile=pathlib.Path("path/to/localhost.key"),
)

# Then use the context in websockets.serve
async with websockets.serve(
    handler, host, port, ssl=ssl_context
):
    await asyncio.Future()
#+end_src

*** Input Validation

The server processes text input which could potentially be manipulated to:

- Send excessively large content
- Trigger errors in the NLP pipeline
- Consume excessive resources

The following safeguards should be considered:

- Implement input size limits
- Add timeouts for processing
- Validate input format

#+begin_src python
async def process_text(websocket, message):
    try:
        data = json.loads(message)
        if "type" in data and data["type"] == "analyze":
            text = data.get("text", "")
            
            # Input validation
            if len(text) > MAX_TEXT_LENGTH:
                await websocket.send(json.dumps({
                    "type": "error",
                    "message": "Text exceeds maximum length"
                }))
                return
                
            # Continue with processing...
#+end_src

*** Environment Security

When setting up and running this project:

- Use a dedicated virtual environment
- Keep dependencies updated
- Do not run the server as root
- Consider using containerization for isolation

** Vulnerability Response

When a vulnerability is reported:

1. The security team will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
2. We'll investigate and validate the issue
3. We'll develop and test a fix
4. We'll release a patch and notify users

** Security Updates

Security updates will be announced:

- Via GitHub releases
- In the project documentation

** Acknowledgments

We appreciate the responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities and will acknowledge contributors who follow this policy.
